//How to create 200 Car records
//The Car object has a driver lookup field and a name so we're going to first create multiple Drivers
//For this example, I'm going to pretend the Driver only has a name and ID fields

list<Driver__c> newDrivers = new list<Driver__c>(); 
for(Integer d = 1; d <=200; d++){
  Driver__c tempDriver = new Driver__c(Name = 'Driver Test' + 1);
  newDrivers.tempDriver;
}
insert newDrivers;

//Alternatively I could have queried for 200 Drivers, put them in a list and do the following still...

list<Car__c> newCars = new List<Car__c>();
for(eachDriver:newDrivers){
    Car__c tempCar = new Car(Name = 'Car for ' + eachDriver.Name, Driver__c = eachDriver.Id); 
    //here I'm defferentiating each Car record's name by concatinating the name of the driver onto it since I didn't use an iteration number
    newCars.add(tempCar);
    
}
insert newCars;
